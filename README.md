# Codeforces-Contest-Setup
Perl script to setup folders, files, and testing powerhsell scripts for a Codeforces contest specified by its contest ID.

This script is tested on the most recent version of strawberry Perl. To use this script, run the following command:

`perl ccs.pl [Codeforce_Contest_ID]`

replacing [Codeforce_Contest_ID] with the ID located in the contest's URL. Note that the Contest ID is not the same as the Round Number.


Probably won't use this, as Codeforces has too much emphasis on COMPETITIVE programming, while I'm more interested in learning.
